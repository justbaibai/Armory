| [CVE-2020-1941](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1941) | In Apache ActiveMQ 5.0.0 to 5.15.11, the webconsole admin GUI is open to XSS, in the view that lists the contents of a queue. |
| [CVE-2020-13932](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13932) | In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 2.5.0 to 2.13.0, a specially crafted MQTT packet which has an XSS payload as client-id or topic name can exploit this vulnerability. The XSS payload is being injected into the admin console's browser. The XSS payload is triggered in the diagram plugin; queue node and the info section. |
| [CVE-2020-13920](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13920) | Apache ActiveMQ uses LocateRegistry.createRegistry() to create the JMX RMI registry and binds the server to the "jmxrmi" entry. It is possible to connect to the registry without authentication and call the rebind method to rebind jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker creates another server to proxy the original, and bound that, he effectively becomes a man in the middle and is able to intercept the credentials when an user connects. Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12. |
| [CVE-2020-12760](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12760) | An issue was discovered in OpenNMS Horizon before 26.0.1, and Meridian before 2018.1.19 and 2019 before 2019.1.7. The ActiveMQ channel configuration allowed for arbitrary deserialization of Java objects (aka ActiveMQ Minion payload deserialization), leading to remote code execution for any authenticated channel user regardless of its assigned permissions. |
| [CVE-2020-11998](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11998) | A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind. By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map that contains the authentication credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the following attack: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html "A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your Java application execute arbitrary code." Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.13 |
| [CVE-2020-11969](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11969) | If Apache TomEE is configured to use the embedded ActiveMQ broker, and the broker URI includes the useJMX=true parameter, a JMX port is opened on TCP port 1099, which does not include authentication. This affects Apache TomEE 8.0.0-M1 - 8.0.1, Apache TomEE 7.1.0 - 7.1.2, Apache TomEE 7.0.0-M1 - 7.0.7, Apache TomEE 1.0.0 - 1.7.5. |
| [CVE-2020-11111](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11111) | FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.4 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to org.apache.activemq.* (aka activemq-jms, activemq-core, activemq-pool, and activemq-pool-jms). |
| [CVE-2020-10727](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10727) | A flaw was found in ActiveMQ Artemis management API from version 2.7.0 up until 2.12.0, where a user inadvertently stores passwords in plaintext in the Artemis shadow file (etc/artemis-users.properties file) when executing the `resetUsers` operation. A local attacker can use this flaw to read the contents of the Artemis shadow file. |
| [CVE-2019-10247](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10247) | In Eclipse Jetty version 7.x, 8.x, 9.2.27 and older, 9.3.26 and older, and 9.4.16 and older, the server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will reveal the configured fully qualified directory base resource location on the output of the 404 error for not finding a Context that matches the requested path. The default server behavior on jetty-distribution and jetty-home will include at the end of the Handler tree a DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting this 404 error, it presents the various configured contexts as HTML for users to click through to. This produced HTML includes output that contains the configured fully qualified directory base resource location for each context. |
| [CVE-2019-10241](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10241) | In Eclipse Jetty version 9.2.26 and older, 9.3.25 and older, and 9.4.15 and older, the server is vulnerable to XSS conditions if a remote client USES a specially formatted URL against the DefaultServlet or ResourceHandler that is configured for showing a Listing of directory contents. |
| [CVE-2019-0222](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0222) | In Apache ActiveMQ 5.0.0 - 5.15.8, unmarshalling corrupt MQTT frame can lead to broker Out of Memory exception making it unresponsive. |
| [CVE-2019-0188](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0188) | Apache Camel prior to 2.24.0 contains an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability (CWE-611) due to using an outdated vulnerable JSON-lib library. This affects only the camel-xmljson component, which was removed. |
| [CVE-2018-8034](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8034) | The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was missing. It is now enabled by default. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, and 7.0.35 to 7.0.88. |
| [CVE-2018-8014](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8014) | The defaults settings for the CORS filter provided in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.8, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, 7.0.41 to 7.0.88 are insecure and enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. It is expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore, it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue. |
| [CVE-2018-8006](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8006) | An instance of a cross-site scripting vulnerability was identified to be present in the web based administration console on the queue.jsp page of Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.0.0 to 5.15.5. The root cause of this issue is improper data filtering of the QueueFilter parameter. |
| [CVE-2018-1310](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1310) | Apache NiFi JMS Deserialization issue because of ActiveMQ client vulnerability. Malicious JMS content could cause denial of service. See ActiveMQ CVE-2015-5254 announcement for more information. The fix to upgrade the activemq-client library to 5.15.3 was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.6.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release. |
| [CVE-2018-1270](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1270) | Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message to the broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack. |
| [CVE-2018-11775](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11775) | TLS hostname verification when using the Apache ActiveMQ Client before 5.15.6 was missing which could make the client vulnerable to a MITM attack between a Java application using the ActiveMQ client and the ActiveMQ server. This is now enabled by default. |
| [CVE-2017-6056](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6056) | It was discovered that a programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an infinite loop. The denial of service is easily achievable as a consequence of backporting a CVE-2016-6816 fix but not backporting the fix for Tomcat bug 57544. Distributions affected by this backporting issue include Debian (before 7.0.56-3+deb8u8 and 8.0.14-1+deb8u7 in jessie) and Ubuntu. |
| [CVE-2017-5648](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5648) | While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to application listeners in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.11, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.75 did not use the appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application. |
| [CVE-2017-5168](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5168) | An issue was discovered in Hanwha Techwin Smart Security Manager Versions 1.5 and prior. Multiple Path Traversal vulnerabilities have been identified. The flaws exist within the ActiveMQ Broker service that is installed as part of the product. By issuing specific HTTP requests, if a user visits a malicious page, an attacker can gain access to arbitrary files on the server. Smart Security Manager Versions 1.4 and prior to 1.31 are affected by these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can allow for remote code execution. |
| [CVE-2017-15709](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15709) | When using the OpenWire protocol in ActiveMQ versions 5.14.0 to 5.15.2 it was found that certain system details (such as the OS and kernel version) are exposed as plain text. |
| [CVE-2016-9008](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9008) | IBM UrbanCode Deploy could allow a malicious user to access the Agent Relay ActiveMQ Broker JMX interface and run plugins on the agent. |
| [CVE-2016-6810](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6810) | In Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.14.2, an instance of a cross-site scripting vulnerability was identified to be present in the web based administration console. The root cause of this issue is improper user data output validation. |
| [CVE-2016-5388](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5388) | Apache Tomcat 7.x through 7.0.70 and 8.x through 8.5.4, when the CGI Servlet is enabled, follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. NOTE: the vendor states "A mitigation is planned for future releases of Tomcat, tracked as CVE-2016-5388"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability. |
| [CVE-2016-4978](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4978) | The getObject method of the javax.jms.ObjectMessage class in the (1) JMS Core client, (2) Artemis broker, and (3) Artemis REST component in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis before 1.4.0 might allow remote authenticated users with permission to send messages to the Artemis broker to deserialize arbitrary objects and execute arbitrary code by leveraging gadget classes being present on the Artemis classpath. |
